# Fibonacci_Analysis
Different methods of computing the fibonacci sequence using recursion, dynamic programming and matricies. 

-**Method 1**: Basic recursive call. Not efficient because it re-computes already computed values in the recursion tree. `Exponential time complexity`.
-**Method 2**: Dynamic programming approach #1. Efficient in the sense of time because we use a table to compute future values. `O(N) time complexity`.
-**Method 3**: Dynamic programming approach #2. Efficient in the sense of time and good with space. `O(N) time complexity`.
-**Method 4**: Q-Matrix Approach. Very efficient. `O(log(n))`
